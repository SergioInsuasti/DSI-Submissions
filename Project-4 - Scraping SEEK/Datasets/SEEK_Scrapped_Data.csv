The Bureau undertakes research in fulfilment of its responsibilities as a national research agency, contributing to the development of weather and climate applications for the needs of the Australian community, supporting the Bureau's operational
          services, and advancing meteorological and earth system science in Australia and globally. The Science to Services Program carries out the majority of research and development activities in the Bureau, covering the broad fields of weather, climate,
          oceanography, earth systems modelling, and applications.
The Climate Research Section focuses more specifically on climate projections, climate dynamics and feedbacks, intra-seasonal to decadal predictability, climate model assessment, and prediction products and verification. Much of the research and
          development work is carried out on high performance computing (HPC) platforms at the Bureau and the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), based at the Australian National University.
We are looking for an outstanding climate scientist to conduct climate research to improve understanding of past and future climate change and climate variability in the Australian region. You will be a member of a small team that contributes
          to research programmes including a three-year climate research programme with the Victorian government. The team conducts research to determine the underlying causes of observed climate change and climate variability and to determine likely
          future changes to climate. 
You will conduct research, both independently and under guidance, into climate change and climate variability, and analyse observational data and extremely large data sets based on output from many climate models using a variety of sophisticated
          statistical techniques. This research will be used to improve understanding of past and future climate change and climate variability in the Australian region, with a particular focus on the state of Victoria.
You will need to have:

a very good understanding of climate variability and climate change in the Australian region and beyond. This includes knowledge of major factors influencing Australian climate, including ENSO, naturally-occurring decadal climate variability,
            and the enhanced greenhouse effect;
flexibility to work effectively and productively as a member of a team under the direction of more senior scientists, and an ability to plan and undertake research and to publish research results, in the international peer-reviewed literature,
            of relevance to the Bureau’s mission, and to contribute to the milestone reports for external stakeholders; and
strong programming skills, including extensive experience with UNIX, and with scientific and visualisation languages such as IDL, NCL, and/or Python. Some knowledge of GIS is desirable.

The applicant will also need to have an excellent knowledge of climate variability and climate change in the Australian region, the ability to devise, test and publish research in the international peer-reviewed literature, the ability to meet
          deadlines, work effectively as part of a small team, and have extensive experience in programming in a UNIX environment and in the use of scientific visualisation tools.
The position will involve close collaboration with other scientific and technical staff in the Bureau and other agencies. Experience liaising effectively with external stakeholders or the potential to do so is an advantage.
Classification of the position upon commencement will be determined by the level of experience and skills of the successful candidate.

          oceanography, earth systems modelling, and applications.
The Climate Research Section focuses more specifically on climate projections, climate dynamics and feedbacks, intra-seasonal to decadal predictability, climate model assessment, and prediction products and verification. Much of the research and
          development work is carried out on high performance computing (HPC) platforms at the Bureau and the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), based at the Australian National University.
We are looking for an outstanding climate scientist to conduct climate research to improve understanding of past and future climate change and climate variability in the Australian region. You will be a member of a small team that contributes
          to research programmes including a three-year climate research programme with the Victorian government. The team conducts research to determine the underlying causes of observed climate change and climate variability and to determine likely
          future changes to climate. 
You will conduct research, both independently and under guidance, into climate change and climate variability, and analyse observational data and extremely large data sets based on output from many climate models using a variety of sophisticated
          statistical techniques. This research will be used to improve understanding of past and future climate change and climate variability in the Australian region, with a particular focus on the state of Victoria.
You will need to have:

a very good understanding of climate variability and climate change in the Australian region and beyond. This includes knowledge of major factors influencing Australian climate, including ENSO, naturally-occurring decadal climate variability,
            and the enhanced greenhouse effect;
flexibility to work effectively and productively as a member of a team under the direction of more senior scientists, and an ability to plan and undertake research and to publish research results, in the international peer-reviewed literature,
            of relevance to the Bureau’s mission, and to contribute to the milestone reports for external stakeholders; and
strong programming skills, including extensive experience with UNIX, and with scientific and visualisation languages such as IDL, NCL, and/or Python. Some knowledge of GIS is desirable.

The applicant will also need to have an excellent knowledge of climate variability and climate change in the Australian region, the ability to devise, test and publish research in the international peer-reviewed literature, the ability to meet
          deadlines, work effectively as part of a small team, and have extensive experience in programming in a UNIX environment and in the use of scientific visualisation tools.
The position will involve close collaboration with other scientific and technical staff in the Bureau and other agencies. Experience liaising effectively with external stakeholders or the potential to do so is an advantage.
Classification of the position upon commencement will be determined by the level of experience and skills of the successful candidate.
